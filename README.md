# Dog Nutrition Hero Section – Technical Test

This project is a responsive hero section built as part of the Customer Success Associate technical test for GemCommerce.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- **HTML5** for the structure
- **Tailwind CSS (via CDN)** for styling and layout
- **Flexbox and Grid** for responsive alignment
- **GitHub Pages** for deployment

## 🧱 Code Structure
The section consists of:
- A centered heading describing the brand message
- A three-column layout:
  - Left and right: feature blocks with icons and descriptions
  - Center: a circular image of dog food
- A CTA button styled with Tailwind classes
- A small payment method row and guarantee note

Tailwind's utility classes were used to manage spacing, font sizes, responsiveness, and hover effects.

## 📱 Responsiveness
- On small screens: layout stacks vertically using `flex-col`
- On medium and larger screens: layout becomes `flex-row`
- Images and text automatically adjust for different device sizes

## 📦 Deployment
The project is live at: [https://johnmattee.github.io](#)
